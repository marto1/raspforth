Based on uart01, this one enables the uart rxd1 receiver (gpio15).
It starts by printing 12345678 then whatever you type on the terminal

See the top level README file for information on how to connect the
raspi uart to your host computer.

Using a dumb terminal (minicom) 115200 board No parity 8 bits 1 stop
bit, no flow control (might have to exit minicom and start again for
the flow control setting to take).  What you type on the dumb terminal
comes back.
